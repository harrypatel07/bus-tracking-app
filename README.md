# Cyberjaya Tech Volunteer - Bus Tracking App

A mobile app for Cyberjaya public bus users.

## Description

Just like at other places, the Cyberjaya public bus users still face the trivial issues with the public bus services :
- The bus is frequently NOT on time. Most of the time, users arrived early at the bus stop but they have to wait for an extended time
- There is no way to know where is the next bus coming in, how far is it from the current stop and when will it reach the current stop
- For new users, there is no schedule easily available at the bus stop

The Cyberjaya Tech Volunteers are building a mobile app that will provide real-time location and ETA of these public buses. The simplest solution is to have our own tracking device onboard these buses. Unfortunately, due to regulation, that is currently not possible.

Our current solution is, with the support of Cyberjaya City Planner, Cyberview, to have cameras at each relevant bus stops. The system will use these cameras to identify if any of the public buses stop at the stop (or passing through) and provide real-time updates to the users via notification. The system is also intended to provide a real-time tracking functionality for all relevant bus in Cyberjaya via the mobile app.

Planting cameras at the bus stop also allows us to extend the system to other functionalities. For example, a simple safety or surveillance camera at these bus stops. These, however, will be added later in the future.
